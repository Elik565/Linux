The one opened the door wth a latch-key and went n, followed by
a young fellow who awkwardly removed hs cap. He wore rough
clothes that smacked of the sea, and he was manfestly out of place
n the spacous hall n whch he found hmself. He dd not know what
to do wth hs cap, and was stuffng t nto hs coat pocket when the
other took t from hm. The act was done quetly and naturally, and
the awkward young fellow apprecated t. “He understands,” was hs
thought. “He’ll see me through all rght.”
He walked at the other’s heels wth a swng to hs shoulders, and
hs legs spread unwttngly, as f the level floors were tltng up and
snkng down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wde rooms
seemed too narrow for hs rollng gat, and to hmself he was n terror
lest hs broad shoulders should collde wth the doorways or sweep
the brc-a-brac from the low mantel. He recoled from sde to sde
between the varous objects and multpled the hazards that n realty
lodged only n hs mnd. Between a grand pano and a centre-table
pled hgh wth books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast,
yet he essayed t wth trepdaton. Hs heavy arms hung loosely at hs
sdes. He dd not know what to do wth those arms and hands, and
when, to hs excted vson, one arm seemed lable to brush aganst
the books on the table, he lurched away lke a frghtened horse,
barely mssng the pano stool. He watched the easy walk of the
other n front of hm, and for the frst tme realzed that hs walk was
dfferent from that of other men. He experenced a momentary pang
of shame that he should walk so uncouthly. The sweat burst through
the skn of hs forehead n tny beads, and he paused and mopped
hs bronzed face wth hs handkerchef.
